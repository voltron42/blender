# blender
`A collection of JavaScript utilities.`

Blender is meant to be a collection of JavaScript utilities which are __not__ mutually inclusive. In other words, unlike JavaScript frameworks like JQuery, Underscore, Backbone, or Angular, which contain vast collections of functionality wrapped up in a single package, Blender is divided out into smaller pieces, with each piece being some small _isolated_ functionality. To that end, each piece of blender is divided to it's own folder, with it's own documentation, but grouped by discipline.

These disciplines and their pieces are as follows:

* `append` -- functionality added to existing JavaScript prototypes
* `structure` -- functionality for the architecting and organizing of code
* `testing` -- components for unit testing
