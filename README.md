# blender
`A collection of JavaScript utilities.`

Blender is meant to be a collection of JavaScript utilities which are __not__ mutually inclusive. In other words, unlike JavaScript frameworks like JQuery, Underscore, Backbone, or Angular, which contain vast collections of functionality wrapped up in a single package, Blender is divided out into smaller pieces, with each piece being some small _isolated_ functionality. To that end, each piece of blender is divided to it's own folder, with it's own documentation, but grouped by discipline.
